# Coding tasks for data engineers

Hello and welcome to the coding tasks for data engineers! The exercise covers [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html), [Dataframes](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html), Scala/Java and Apache MAVEN. We hope you will enjoy it!

### Tasks

The goals of the tasks are to pass all tests and implement it in a way that it performs very well for big data. The steps in detail:

1. Fork the project and create a new branch for your implementation
2. Implement the function, according to documentation and tests
3. Build the module and pass all the tests you created
4. Update the chapter "Describe your solution" in the README files. Please explain your approach thoroughly and explain any other approach you may have.
5. Create a pull request

### Comment

It's ok if you're not familiar with Scala. Just implement it in Java and replace the [Implicit Class](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/implicit-classes.html) with an instance of your Java class.
